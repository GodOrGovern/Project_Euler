''' Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call
it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true: S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot
be equal. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C). Using e105
text file with one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve elements (the two
examples given above are the first two sets in the file), identify all the
special sum sets, A1, A2, ..., A_k, and find the value of S(A1) + S(A2) + ...
